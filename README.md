## Features Yet to Be Implemented

### **1. Candidate Pictures**
   - Add support for uploading and displaying candidate pictures in ballots.

### **2. Ballot Management**
   - Restrict ballot editing: Ensure ballots can only be edited until the election start date.
   - Automate the `active` column: Dynamically set the `active` state of a ballot based on the current date.
   - Implement error handling to provide meaningful user feedback while concealing technical details.

### **3. Logging for Ballot Operations**
   - Log the following operations:
     - **Creating** a ballot.
     - **Editing** a ballot.
     - **Deleting** a ballot.
   - Use the existing logging table and include details like the user performing the action and the timestamp.

### **4. User and Society Management**
   - **Society Management**:
     - Add CRUD functionality for societies.
   - **User Management**:
     - Add CRUD functionality for users.

### **5. Voting System Enhancements**
   - Improve vote visualizations to display:
     - Voting progress and participation rates.
     - Election results in a user-friendly, interactive format.
   - Prevent users from having multiple active sessions to enhance security.

### **6. UI/UX Improvements**
   - Redesign the user interface for better usability and aesthetics.
   - Implement user feedback mechanisms:
     - Success notifications (e.g., "Ballot created successfully").
     - Error alerts (e.g., "Something went wrong while creating the ballot").
   - Support real-time feedback and improved navigation.

### **7. Security Enhancements**
   - Prevent duplicate user sessions by restricting users to one active session at a time.
   - Ensure only minimal error information is displayed to users while logging detailed errors for developers.
   - Encrypt sensitive data beyond passwords, where applicable.

### **8. Error Handling**
   - Implement error handling to:
     - Provide generic messages for end users to protect sensitive information.
     - Log detailed technical errors for developers to debug issues effectively.

### **9. Testing**
   - Create unit tests from scratch to validate business logic and database interactions.
   - Plan and execute stress testing to assess the systemâ€™s performance under load.
   - Include automated regression tests to replace manual processes.

### **10. Deployment and CI/CD**
   - Automate deployment pipelines for staging and production environments.
   - Utilize tools like Docker for containerized deployments.

### **11. Documentation**
   - Expand API documentation using Swagger.
   - Create a comprehensive user manual for non-technical users.
   - Write developer onboarding documentation to help new contributors understand the codebase.
